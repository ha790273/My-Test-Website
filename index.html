                                A Simple-Ish Guide On How To Make A Website 




--------------------- To start making a website you need todo these important things: ------------------------------


1. Declare the document type with <!DOCTYPE html>
2. Use <html> tags to enclose the entire HTML document
3. Use <head> tags to enclose meta-information about the document, such as the title
4. Use <title> tags within the head to set the title of the webpage
5. Use <body> tags to enclose the content of the webpage that will be displayed to users
6. Use heading tags (h1 to h6) to create headings of different levels

* To use mutiline comments in HTML, enclose the comment text within <!-- TEXT GOES HERE 
And to close it off do -->


<!-- Below is an example of a mutiline commment in HTML -->


<!--
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span across multiple lines,
  and all the content within these tags
  will be ignored by the browser.

--> 

<!--
 -------------------------------------- H1-H6 and Paragraph Explanation -------------------------------------------------------- 

 <h1>-<h6> are heading tags used to define headings in HTML, with h1 being the highest level and h6 the lowest.
 This means that h1 is typically used for main titles, while h6 is used for subheadings or less important headings.


 The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text in HTML.
 Note: There are some extra '>' characters at the end of the heading and body tags that should be removed for proper HTML syntax. 
 
 -->

 <!--
 ----------------------------------- Other usful / Random HTML tags -------------------------------------------------------------

# Other useful HTML tags / Random tags have 99 to keep track of randoms tags and usful extra stuff


To make spaces in HTML you can use <br> which breaks the line and moves the text to the next line.
In simple terms, this just skips a line for you.

To create a horizontal line across the webpage, you can use the <hr> tag.

You can also link other HTML5 files on here or CSS by doing the follwoing:

    <a href="lyrics.html">
    This contains lyrics to Take On Me
    </a>
-->

<!--
------------------------------------- Lorem Ipsum Explanation -------------------------------------------------------------
lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

lorem is just used as a placeholder text in web design and publishing to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content.
or it can just be random text to fill up space.

-------------------------------------- HyperLinks or links -----------------------------------------------------

To add a link use the lines of code below:
    
    <a>
    This  is a link
    </a>


The a means anchor, and then we sandwitch some text inbetween those
But where missing something to make this register this as a link for the viewer / user to click on

To fix the code above we can do this:

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw">
    Click me 
    </a>

An hre is an attribute which is a name value pair which modies the behavoir of the element and href means an hypertext referance
and to add the link itself to a website we put it in the quotaion marks ""
When you click on the text "Click me" it sends you to the website link you clicked on



What is a target?
A target is another attribute that can be added to the <a> tag to specify where to open the linked document.
For example, to open the link in a new tab, you can use target="_blank" like this:

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw"
    target="_blank">
    Click me 
    </a>

What is a title?
A title is another attribute that can be added to the <a> tag to provide additional information about the link.
A title can be displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link.
For example, to add a title to the link, you can use title="This is a YouTube video" like this:

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw"
    target="_blank"
    title="This is a YouTube video">
    Click me 
    </a>

How to mail someone using a link?
To do this use you add mailto: Then the email adress after, like this:

    <a href="mailto:random.ran@gmail.com">
    Email Me
    </a>

        <dt>Ventor Star Destroyer</dt>
            <br>
            <dd>The <b>Venator-class Star Destroyer</b>, also known as the <b>Venator-class cruiser</b>, was a class of more than 1,000 meter-long attack cruiser of the Star Destroyer design family that was operated by the navy of the Galactic Republic. Designed by Lira Wessex to feature a double-wedge design and perform a wide range of missions, the Venator was the first class of Star Destroyer to be manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Alternatively known as the <b>Republic cruiser</b>, <b>Republic attack cruiser</b>, or <b>Republic Star Destroyer</b>, it was a versatile capital ship capable of serving as both a combatant in ship-to-ship naval warfare and a starfighter carrier, while also being employed as a troop transport, cargo ship, and supply and replenishment vessel. As a warship, Venators were protected by powerful deflector shields and boasted a range of weaponry. For its carrier role, a large flight deck, along with hangars to accommodate a complement of starfighters, gunships, shuttles, armored vehicles and other craft, was contained in the forward section, while three more docking bays were located around the ship. At least two variants existed, the Venator I-class and the Venator II-class.</dd>
            <br>
        <dt>Imperial Star Destroyer</dt>
            <br>
            <dd>The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer was a model of Imperial-class Star Destroyer in the service of the Imperial Navy. A wedge-shaped capital ship, it bristled with weapons emplacements, assault troops, boarding craft, and TIE fighter series starfighters. In the era of the Galactic Empire, its command bridge was staffed by the finest crewmen in the navy.</dd>
            <br>
            <dd>At first, Star Destroyers were deployed to sectors and systems caught in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, where they would crush any signs of sedition. During the Galactic Civil War the Destroyer's role changed to hunting down high value Rebel targets and bases. They fought in notable battles such as the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor. The Imperial II-class Star Destroyer was a derivative of the Imperial I-class.</dd>
            <br>
        <dt>CR90 Corvette</dt>
            <br>
            <dd>CR90 corvettes, also identified as the CR90 class and colloquially known as Corellian corvettes or blockade runners, were consular vessels manufactured by the Corellian Engineering Corporation. While the CR90 would see initial use within the late Galactic Republic and Imperial Senate, many vessels would be appropriated by the early rebellion and Rebel Alliance against the First Galactic Empire, despite not being designed as a combat-oriented vessel. They were later used by the navies of both the New Republic and the Resistance.</dd>
            <br>

        <dt>Mon Calamari Cruiser</dt>
            <br>
            <dd>The MC-series star cruiser, or simply the Mon Calamari cruiser, was a series of starships that were produced by Mon Calamari Shipyards. The ships were known for their organic-looking, bulbous shape. Many MC-series Star Cruisers were used as part of the Rebel Alliance, and were their main capital ships.[1] After the Battle of Yavin, Han Solo, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker went to Mon Cala to convince the Mon Calamari to donate their fleet to the rebel cause. After seeing the broadcast of the death of their king, the Mon Calamari mutinied against the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance.[7] During the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance fielded a number of similar Mon Calamari cruisers to Home One in an attempt to conceal the identity of Admiral Gial Ackbar's command ship.[8]</dd>
